# Conda

**Conda** is a simple contact form application built with a Laravel backend and a Vue.js frontend. The project is styled using TailwindCSS and is fully Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## Features

- **Frontend**:
  - A responsive contact form with fields for Name, Email, Subject, and Message.
  - Client-side validation using Vue.js, ensuring all fields are filled correctly.
  - Styled with TailwindCSS for a modern, clean user interface.
  
- **Backend**:
  - A robust Laravel API to handle form submissions.
  - Validates data on the server-side for security and reliability.
  - Stores submitted form data in a MySQL database (`contacts` table).
  - Sends confirmation emails using Mailhog for local testing.
  - Returns JSON responses indicating the success or failure of form submissions.
  - Includes unit tests to ensure API reliability and correctness.

- **Dockerized**:
  - The entire application runs in Docker containers for easy setup and consistency across environments.
  - Includes services for the Laravel backend, Vue.js frontend, MySQL database, and Mailhog for email testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required to run the application in a containerized environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dceekay/conda.git
   cd conda
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:

   Copy the example environment file and update the configuration if needed:

   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

   Configure the `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your database and mail settings.

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary PHP dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   composer install
   ```

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**:

   Run the Laravel migrations to create the required database tables:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Docker Containers**:

   Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will start the backend, frontend, MySQL, and Mailhog services.

## Usage

- **API Endpoint**: Access the API for the contact form at [http://localhost:8000/api/contact](http://localhost:8000/api/contact).
- **Frontend**: View and interact with the frontend application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- **Mailhog**: Check sent emails via Mailhog at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).

### Testing

- **Backend Tests**:

  Run the Laravel unit tests to verify the API functionality:

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec backend php artisan test
  ```

### Project Structure

- **`backend/`**: Contains the Laravel backend application.
- **`frontend/`**: Contains the Vue.js frontend application.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Configuration file to orchestrate the application’s Docker containers.
